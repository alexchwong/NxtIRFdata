Description: NxtIRFdata is a companion package for NxtIRF, which is an IRFinder-
    based R package for Intron Retention and Alternative Splicing quantitation
    for RNA-seq BAM files. NxtIRFdata contains Mappability files required for 
    the generation of human and mouse references. NxtIRFdata also contains a 
    synthetic genome reference and example BAM files used to test NxtIRF. 
	BAM files are based on 6 samples from the Leucegene dataset provided by 
    NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE67039.
